[DEMO](https://weather-two-sigma.vercel.app) â€” see the result.

<strong>In this Next.JS project I've tried to show how to use OpenWeather API in small weather app. Also for background image I used Freepik API from their Figma plugin.</strong>

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you've got installed Node v.16. Then run `npm install` && `npm run dev`.

2. Don't forget to generate [OpenWeather API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and write it in `.env` as `API_KEY` (example in `.env.example`).

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

4. To build the app, just run `npm run build`.
